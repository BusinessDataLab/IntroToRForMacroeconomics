time(co2M)[1:8]

# Fitting a Linear Trend To co2M
# create the time series t, 
# which is done using the time command which creates a time series with the same dates. 
# t is a time series that starts on March 1958 like co2M.
# offset values: 0 (the default) indicates the start of the unit, 0.5 the middle and 1 the end of the interval.
t <- time(co2M, offset=0.5)

# Remember the Linear Trend equation i.e. T_t = a + bt
# * value of "a" is meaningless, so we focus the model on the last part of the equation 
# Just like the formula below shows the linear relationship between co2M and the time series object created
# Formula = co2M~t 
fit <- lm(co2M~t) # pass the formula to the  linear model command
fit # returns the values of a and b which are named (Intercept) and t respectively

# Note:
# t in the linear trend equation is the date series we previously created
# t returned from the model is the value for b which is the variation or annual change

# So, the linear trend equation is now  T_t = -2749.17 + 1.56t 
# T <- -2749.17+1.56*t

# Cyclical Component of the  CO2  Emissions Series
# First, we create the detrended series and name it CSI (for  Ct+St+It ):
# i.e. X_t-T_t = Ct+St+It


# So, the sum of the cyclical(C), seasonal(S) and irregular(I) component 
# is equal to the detrended series
CSI <- co2M-trend2

# To extract  Ct , we use the function filter. 
# The first argument is the series and the second is the filter, which is a list of weights. 
# Example
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
filter(x, filter=c(1/3,1/3,1/3)) # the filter here is what we defined as an MA(3) 

# Filters for monthly and quarterly series
# cyclical component is extracted using an MA(5) for quarterly series 
# and an MA(13) for monthly series.

# So, the filter for quarterly series is a list of 5 elements equal to 1/5, 
# and it is a list of 13 elements equal to 1/13 for monthly series. As shown below:

rep(1/5,5)


rep(1/13,13)

# the cyclical component  Ct  of the  CO2  emissions series can be extracted as follows:

C <- filter(CSI, filter=rep(1/13,13)) # cyclical component  Ct for monthly series
# C <- filter(CSI, filter=rep(1/5,5)) # cyclical component  Ct for quarter series

# Extract seasonal component using the command decompose.

# Deseasonalizing a Series
